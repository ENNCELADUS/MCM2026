\subsubsection{Bootstrapping and Mass Sourcing Evolution}
The model validates the \textbf{System Bootstrapping Effect}. By the end of the project, 80.0\% of the mass is satisfied by lunar ISRU.

The initial Earth-sourced ``seeds'' total \textbf{0.02 million tons} (\textbf{0.04 million tons} via rockets, \textbf{0.00 million tons} via Space Elevator), enabling a transition to self-replication around \textbf{2050}.

\subsubsection{Optimal Construction Timeline}
The resulting Gantt chart reveals three distinct phases: Industrial Seeding (2050--2050), Capacity Self-Replication (2050--2060), Urban Habitation Expansion (2060--2111).

\subsubsection{Scenario Summary}
\textbf{Scenario R-only} completes in \textbf{61.5 years} (approx. 2112).
