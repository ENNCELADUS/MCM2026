\subsubsection{Scenario Dominance and Trade-offs}
Simulation results confirm multiple strategies meet the target within a half-century: Scenario A (Elevator-only), Scenario C (Hybrid Model).

The hybrid model optimizes the ``Cold Start'' problem: rockets are utilized for the initial \textbf{0.04 million tons} of ``technological seeds'' (high-complexity robotics and energy modules), while the Space Elevator assumes the role of a bulk carrier for Tier 2 expansion. This prevents the ``Slow Start'' of a pure elevator system (completion $>150$ years) and the ``Fiscal Explosion'' of a pure rocket system.
