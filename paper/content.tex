\begin{abstract}
Stair wear patterns in historic buildings can provide valuable archaeological evidence regarding the building's age, usage and traffic patterns throughout history. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive mathematical framework to analyze wear patterns and provide archaeologists with quatitative tools for historical interpretation.
    
First, we establish a non-destructive measurement methodology including \textbf{physical, chemical and biological} measurements. Physical measurements involve \textbf{3D scanning} of stairs and monocular depth estimation. Chemical measurements include \textbf{isotope analysis} and mineral composition testing. Biological measurements involve the study of microbial colonies.
Then, we personally collected top-down photos of stairs from ancient buildings. Using \textbf{depth map estimation} methods, we drew heatmaps and obtained wear data.

Following data collection, we address the challenge of quantifying wear volume from discrete point cloud data. We employ\textbf{ Delaunay triangulation} to transform the theoretical volume integral into a weighted summation of local triangular volumes, thus accurately calculating spatial wear volume.

Second, we build a \textbf{Daily Foot Traffic Model} based on the Archard equation. We take \textbf{Archard Adhesive Wear Model} and \textbf{Abrasive Wear Model} both into consideration. Besides, we use \textbf{Bayesian Inversion Framework} to calculate the construction time to provide essential parameter.

Third, we establish a \textbf{Wear Distribution Model} to determine movement patterns and simultaneous occupancy levels. The model analyzes wear patterns to deduce whether people moved in single file or side by side, and whether there were predominant directional preferences.

For age estimation, we employ multiple approaches: \textbf{C14 dating method} for wooden staircases, \textbf{weathering degree analysis} for stone staircases, and \textbf{Bayesian inversion}.We constructed a \textbf{weighted evaluation model} of three representative \textbf{Chemistry Weathering Indecies} to evaluate the weathering condition of stone, providing information about its age.

To detect repairs or renovations, we analyze age distribution discontinuities using anomaly detection methods like the \textbf{Z-score}. We also verify the consistency of wear patterns with available historical information. For material source verification, we use the \textbf{Archard Wear Model} to calculate wear coefficients and perform chemical composition analysis to trace the origin of materials. We analyze usage patterns by examining the distribution of wear depth. By calculating the kurtosis of the distribution, we determine the usage pattern of stairs.

Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the key parameters of our model to evaluate its responsiveness. The results demonstrate strong robustness.  

\textbf{Key Words:} Stair Wear, Archard Equation, Depth Estimation, Weathering Degree Model, Bayesian Inversion

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Background}
The dream of extending human civilization to the Moon has transitioned from science fiction to a pressing logistical challenge as we approach the mid-21st century. At the heart of this ambition lies the fundamental problem of Earth-to-Moon transportation. Traditionally, space exploration has relied exclusively on rocket propulsion systems, such as the advanced Falcon Heavy, which are estimated to carry between 100 to 150 metric tons of payload to the lunar surface per launch by 2050. While reliable, traditional chemical rockets are inherently limited by the "rocket equation," where a significant portion of the launch mass must be dedicated to fuel, resulting in high costs and substantial atmospheric pollution.

To overcome these barriers, the concept of a Space Elevator System offers a revolutionary paradigm for interplanetary logistics. This system is envisioned as a scalable, electrically powered infrastructure consisting of three "Galactic Harbours" strategically positioned 120 degrees apart along the Earth's equator. Each harbour comprises a single Earth port connected via two 100,000 km-long graphene tethers to apex anchors. Unlike the single-step trajectory of a rocket, the Space Elevator employs a two-step delivery process: payloads are first lifted from the Earth port to the apex anchor, and then ferried to the Moon via specialized rockets using significantly less fuel. This infrastructure promises a "green" alternative capable of moving 179,000 metric tons annually without atmospheric degradation, providing a consistent and cost-effective corridor to space.

The major problems dealt with in this paper will be specified in Section 1.3.

\subsection{Literature Review} 
Sustainable lunar colonization requires a transition from intermittent exploration to high-throughput logistical corridors. While Edwards\textsuperscript{\cite{edwards2003}} and Swan et al.\textsuperscript{\cite{swan2020}} established the mechanical and architectural viability of space elevators, the 100-million-ton demand necessitates a shift toward autonomous infrastructure bootstrapping. Sanders and Larson\textsuperscript{\cite{sanders2013}} identified In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) as a primary mass-reduction lever, and Mueller et al.\textsuperscript{\cite{mueller2016}} advanced robotic assembly; however, these micro-scale construction models remain decoupled from macro-scale logistics. Crucially, existing research often overlooks the stochastic propagation of tether oscillations and mission failures within the industrial growth cycle. Our work addresses this gap by synthesizing a hierarchical optimization framework that synchronizes interplanetary network flows with endogenous capacity growth, providing a robust decision-support tool for the 2050 colonization horizon.

\subsection{Problem Restatement and Analysis}

To provide the Moon Colony Management Agency with a concise yet robust framework, we restate the project requirements for transporting  million metric tons of material to support a 100,000-person colony by 2050. After normalizing technical parameters for both Galactic Harbours and rocket launch sites, we address the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Problem 1.} Calculate and compare the total time required to transport  tons across exclusive elevator, exclusive rocket, and hybrid delivery modes.
\item \textbf{Problem 2.} Quantify total expenditures, specifically contrasting the two-step elevator delivery process against the single-step direct rocket launch.
\item \textbf{Problem 3.} Determine the optimal allocation ratio between elevator and rocket systems to maximize mass throughput while minimizing total economic burden.
\item \textbf{Problem 4.} Evaluate fluctuations in cost and timeline under non-ideal conditions, such as tether swaying, mechanical failures, or rocket anomalies.
\item \textbf{Problem 5.} Investigate the total annual water needs to sustain a fully operational colony of 100,000 inhabitants.
\item \textbf{Problem 6.} Calculate additional costs and delivery cycles required to ensure sufficient life-support supplies for the colony’s inaugural year.
\item \textbf{Problem 7.} Analyze atmospheric pollution and ecological damage, contrasting the green efficiency of elevators with traditional chemical propulsion.
\item \textbf{Problem 8.} Develop adjustments to the logistical models to minimize environmental degradation without compromising critical material flow rates.
\end{itemize}

Finally, we will synthesize these findings into a one-page strategic recommendation letter addressed to the MCM Agency.

\section{Methodology and Model Formulation}

\subsection{Strategic Framework: Autonomous Lunar Urbanization}

Our design for the establishment of a 100,000-person lunar colony is formulated as a dynamic process of autonomous industrial evolution. Our strategy prioritizes a \textbf{"Robot-First" developmental logic}, where the initial infrastructure is entirely managed and executed by intelligent robotic units\textsuperscript{\cite{ellery2016}}. In this framework, the construction of human living quarters represents the terminal phase; once the habitation zones are operational and life-support systems are verified, the colony establishment process is considered complete. This approach ensures that the lunar environment is fundamentally transformed into a habitable urban center before the first human residents arrive.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{流程图.png}
    \caption{The Lunar Urbanization Timeline}
    \label{fig:timeline}
\end{figure}

We envision the lunar base's development through a trajectory analogous to terrestrial urbanization but accelerated by robotic efficiencies. Unlike human labor, which is limited by long upbringing cycles, a robotic labor force can be instantaneously deployed upon the establishment of the manufacturing chain. This workforce initiates a self-reinforcing productivity surge that evolves through three strategic stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Bootstrapping Phase:} A "seeding" stage where high-complexity foundational infrastructure and precision components are transported from Earth to establish initial lunar industrial capacity. 
    \item \textbf{The Self-Replication Phase:} A growth explosion where robots utilize In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) to fabricate new labor units and infrastructure, triggering exponential output. 
    \item \textbf{The Saturation Phase:} A logistic stabilization period where growth slows as the colony approaches physical limits, such as thermal dissipation at the lunar poles and cosmic radiation degradation\textsuperscript{\cite{nasa_power2023}}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Notations}
To ensure the clarity and consistency of the mathematical framework, we define a set of primary notations used in our logistics and construction models. These symbols represent the temporal, spatial, and functional components of the Earth-Moon transportation network.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}




\subsection{Assumptions}
Through a complete analysis of the interplanetary logistics problem, in order to simplify our model and ensure computational tractability, we make the following reasonable assumptions based on the physical constraints and technological projections of 2050.

\textbf{Assumption 1: Technical continuity and logistic growth of rocket systems.}

The rocket technology available in 2050 is assumed to be a mature evolution of current systems like Starship and Falcon Heavy. However, the expansion of rocket transport is not infinite; it is constrained by the finite number of global launch sites, such as those in Florida, Kazakhstan, and China. Consequently, we assume the growth of total rocket launch capacity follows a Logistic Growth Model, where the capacity initially increases rapidly but eventually approaches a saturation point determined by environmental and geographical limits].

\textbf{Assumption 2: Physical limits and safety stress of the space elevator system.}

We assume that material science has advanced sufficiently to produce carbon nanotubes (CNT) or graphene with the theoretical strength required for a 100,000 km tether. Nevertheless, the system is subject to strict mechanical safety factors. To prevent tether rupture or excessive swaying, we assume there is a fixed upper limit on the instantaneous payload mass and operational speed, resulting in a maximum annual throughput capacity for each Galactic Harbour.

\textbf{Assumption 3: Seamless transfer from the Galactic Harbour to the Moon.}

The transport process involves a two-step delivery: from Earth to the apex anchor, and then from the anchor to the Moon. We assume that the second leg of this journey is highly efficient and that the rocket ferries operating between the apex anchor and the lunar surface have sufficient capacity to handle all incoming cargo. Therefore, the system's bottleneck is assumed to reside solely in the Earth-to-apex lift phase, rather than the subsequent lunar delivery.

\textbf{Assumption 4: Feasibility of In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU).}

To meet the 100 million metric ton requirement, we assume that lunar regolith and water ice can be successfully extracted and processed into bulk building materials and chemical propellants. This allows for a "system bootstrapping" effect where early infrastructure enables the local production of materials, significantly reducing the total mass that must be transported from Earth's deep gravity well.

\textbf{Assumption 5: Spatial Aggregation of Earth Nodes.}

To reduce computational complexity without losing strategic fidelity, we treat the three equatorial Galactic Harbours as a single super-node, the "Aggregate Galactic Harbour," with a unified capacity sum. Similarly, all global rocket launch sites are modeled as a single "Aggregate Earth Launch Site." This abstraction is valid because the transit time and cost differences between Earth surface locations are negligible compared to the magnitude of interplanetary logistics.

\textbf{Assumption 6: Temporal Discretization.}

The 50-year planning horizon is discretized into monthly intervals ($\Delta t = 1$ month). We assume that material flows, production rates, and resource consumption remain constant within each time step, allowing us to approximate continuous dynamics with a discrete-time difference equation model.

To continue the development of our mathematical framework, we define the operational dynamics of the two primary transportation systems and establish a strategic classification for the materials required for lunar colonization.

\subsection{Material Classification and Logistics Strategy}

To optimize the 100 million metric ton delivery requirement, the \textbf{Equivalent Mass Dynamic Allocation (EMDA)} model categorizes materials by complexity ($\chi$) and value density to determine if they are Earth-transported or produced via lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU).

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\caption{Material Classification and Logistical Strategy}
\label{tab:material_strat}
\begin{tabular}{lp{4.5cm}cp{5.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Typical Components} & \boldmath$\chi_i$ & \textbf{Logistical Strategy \& Mass Ratio} \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{Tier 1: Precision} & Chips, robot brains, precision bio-pharmaceuticals & $\approx 1.0$ & 100\% Earth transport. Mandatory delivery of high-complexity seeds. (15\% Initial $\to$ $<$1\% Mature) \\ 

\textbf{Tier 2: Industrial} & Machine tool parts, flexible films, motors & $0.3 - 0.7$ & Hybrid sourcing. Core components from Earth enable lunar replication. (35\% Initial $\to$ $\sim$4\% Mature) \\ 

\textbf{Tier 3: Basic} & Structural frames, regolith bricks, oxygen, shielding water & $\approx 0.0$ & 100\% lunar ISRU. Bulk materials produced locally to minimize logistical load. (50\% Initial $\to$ $\sim$95\% Mature) \\ 
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The mission utilizes a \textbf{System Bootstrapping Effect}\textsuperscript{\cite{metzger2014}}, where Tier 1 "seeds" enable the growth of lunar production capacity $P_r(t)$. We define the \textbf{Localization Rate} $k_i(t)$ as the ratio of ISRU materials to the total demand for task $i$:
\begin{equation}
k_i(t) = \frac{q^M_{i,t}}{q^M_{i,t} + q^E_{i,t}} \in [0, 1]
\end{equation}
The evolution of $k_i(t)$ is driven by $P_r(t)$, which follows a self-reinforcing differential equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP_r(t)}{dt} = \alpha \cdot P_r(t) + \beta \cdot T_{seed}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the self-replication efficiency and $\beta$ is the input factor of high-complexity Tier 1 components ($T_{seed}$). As $P_r(t)$ increases, $k_i(t)$ for Tier 2 and Tier 3 materials scales accordingly, allowing the colony mass to grow exponentially while the transport burden remains focused on high-value technological payloads.





\subsection{Transport Capacity and Cost Modeling}

The evaluation of the Earth-Moon supply chain requires a rigorous definition of how transport capacity evolves and how operational costs fluctuate over the fifty-year construction horizon. We model the two competing systems—chemical rockets and the space elevator—using distinct mathematical approaches that reflect their unique physical and economic constraints.

\subsubsection{Rocket System Modeling}
The capacity evolution of chemical rocket systems is modeled not by astrodynamics constraints, but by rigorous ground infrastructure analysis. We employ a \textbf{Logistic Growth Model} for the annual launch capacity $L_{cap}(t)$:
\begin{equation}
L_{cap}(t) = \frac{L_{max}}{1 + A \cdot e^{-r(t - t_0)}}
\end{equation}
where $L_{max}$ defines the infrastructure saturation ceiling\textsuperscript{\cite{koelle2000}}. Unlike theoretical orbital limits, this cap is dictated by range operations, pad turnaround times, and safety protocols. Empirical data shows global orbital attempts reaching a peak of 329 in 2025~\textsuperscript{\cite{mcdowell2024}}. The United States Space Force (USSF) has demonstrated high-cadence feasibility with 93 launches from the Eastern Range and 51 from Vandenberg in 2024, executing 28 instances of "2 launches in 24 hours" since 2022~\textsuperscript{\cite{mcdowell2024}}. However, GAO reports flag significant range strain, indicating that while cadence can surge, it cannot scale indefinitely. Consequently, we set a conservative infrastructure ceiling of $L_{max} \approx 1500$ launches/year, assuming a handful of major global spaceports each sustaining operations of 200-300 launches annually.

Parallel to capacity, the unit cost of rocket transport follows a \textbf{Floor-Constrained Exponential Decay Model}\textsuperscript{\cite{econ_bulletin2022}}, fitted to historical market rates from 2005 to 2024 (dropping from $\sim\$25,000/$kg to $\sim\$1,500/$kg)~\textsuperscript{\cite{csis2024}}:
\begin{equation}
Cost_R(t) = (C_{start} - C_{min}) \cdot e^{-\lambda (t - t_{start})} + C_{min}
\end{equation}
Our regression analysis yields a decay rate $\lambda \approx 0.17$, with a projected floor $C_{min} = \$100/$kg. This non-zero floor is critical, representing the irreducible physical costs of propellant, refurbishment, and range operations that persist even with fully reusable architectures.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{rocket_model.png}
    \caption{Projected Evolution of Rocket Systems (2000-2100). (Left) Launch frequency saturation governed by infrastructure limits ($L_{max}=1500$). (Right) Cost reduction curve stabilizing at the \$100/kg operational floor.}
    \label{fig:rocket_model}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Space Elevator System Modeling}

In contrast to the variable dynamics of rocket systems, the Space Elevator System is modeled as a steady-state infrastructure providing continuous throughput. We define its transport capacity $C_E(t)$ as a fixed parameter, anchored to the MCM Agency's baseline specification:
\begin{equation}
C_E(t) = C_{E,ref} \quad \forall t \ge t_0
\end{equation}
Substituting the design parameters for the ``Aggregated Galactic Harbour'' (3 harbours, 2 tethers each), we adopt the constant service rate:
\begin{equation}
C_E(t) = 537,000 \text{ metric tons/year}
\end{equation}
This formulation assumes that the initial deployment phase (2040--2050) has completed, allowing the system to operate at its nominal capacity from the start of the simulation ($t_0=2050$). The capacity is strictly constrained by the tether material strength and climber velocity ($v \approx 200$ km/h), ensuring physical plausibility without assuming speculative upgrades during the project horizon.

Economically, the elevator follows a \textbf{Floor-Constrained Exponential Decay Model}, benefiting from low marginal costs driven by electricity and maintenance efficiencies. We model the unit cost dropping from an initial \$50/kg to a mature floor of \$5/kg:
\begin{equation}
Cost_E(t) = (C_{start} - C_{min}) \cdot e^{-\lambda (t - t_{start})} + C_{min}
\end{equation}
where $C_{start}=\$50$, $C_{min}=\$5$, and $\lambda \approx 0.06$ (annual decay), reflecting the amortization of the massive initial infrastructure investment.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{elevator_model.png}
    \caption{Projected Evolution of Space Elevator Systems (2050-2100). (Left) Capacity growth approaching the 1 Mt/y physical ceiling. (Right) Unit cost reduction driven by economies of scale and amortized infrastructure.}
    \label{fig:elevator_model}
\end{figure}

% \subsection{Multi-Objective Evaluation Framework}
% To rigorously assess the performance of various transportation scenarios, we define a Comprehensive Performance Index ($Z$) as our primary evaluation criterion. This framework balances temporal urgency against economic feasibility:
% \begin{equation}
% \min J = w_C \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} C_{total}(a, t) - w_T \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \text{CumulativeCityMass}(t)
% \end{equation}
% In this expression, $w_T$ and $w_C$ represent the non-negative weight coefficients assigned to time (represented by city mass accumulation) and cost, respectively. This allows the MCM Agency to calibrate the mission priority: a higher $w_T$ prioritizes rapid habitation, whereas a higher $w_C$ favors fiscal sustainability.




\section{Model I: Integrated Hierarchical Logistics Optimization}

\subsection{Optimization Architecture}

To address the coupling between interplanetary transport limits and lunar industrial bootstrapping, we propose an \textbf{Integrated Hierarchical MILP Framework}. Unlike traditional decoupled approaches, this model simultaneously optimizes the macro-level material flow (Earth-to-Moon) and the micro-level industrial capacity expansion within a single global solver.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Layer 1: Strategic Transport (Macro).} Optimizes the multi-modal flow of materials ($x_{a,r,t}$) across the Earth-Moon network, subject to the evolving capacities of the Space Elevator ($C_E(t)$) and Rocket fleet ($L(t)$).
    \item \textbf{Layer 2: Endogenous Industrial Growth (Micro).} Models the colony as a self-replicating system where "seeds" ($P_t$) and raw materials are transformed into new production capacity, governed by an Input-Output capital accumulation logic defined in Eq. \ref{eq:growth}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logistics Graph Definitions}

We define the Earth-Moon logistics interface as a directed graph $G = (\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{A})$, where the node set $\mathcal{N}$ represents the critical physical locations and $\mathcal{A}$ represents the transport arcs.

\textbf{Nodes ($\mathcal{N}$):}
Based on Assumption 5, the network consists of three primary nodes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Aggregate Earth Launch Site ($N_{launch}$):} Represents the collective capacity of all traditional rocket launch complexes (e.g., Kennedy Space Center, Wenchang, Baikonur).
    \item \textbf{Aggregate Galactic Harbour ($N_{port}$):} Represents the unified throughput of the three geostationary space elevator terminals.
    \item \textbf{Lunar Surface ($N_{moon}$):} The destination node where resources are stockpiled and consumed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Arcs ($\mathcal{A}$):}
The transport edges connect these nodes with specific attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rocket Arc ($a_{rock}$):} Direct path from $N_{launch} \to N_{moon}$. Characterized by high cost, high speed (transit time $\approx 5$ days), and capacity $L_{cap}(t)$.
    \item \textbf{Elevator Arc ($a_{elev}$):} Path from $N_{port} \to N_{moon}$. Characterized by low cost, lower speed (transit time $\approx 7$ days incl. transfer), and capacity $C_E(t)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Layer 1: Strategic Transport Constraints}

The transport layer serves as the "Strategic Transport Planner" (Layer 1), formulated as a Time-Dependent Multi-Commodity Network Flow (TDMCNF) problem. It governs the movement of material utilization $x_{a,r,t}$ across the graph $G$.

\subsubsection{Flow Conservation}
The lunar inventory state evolves based on inflows, local production, and consumption:
\begin{equation}
I_{Moon,r,t} = I_{Moon,r,t-1} + \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}_{arr}} x_{a,r,t-\tau_a} + Q_{r,t} - \text{Cons}_{r,t}
\end{equation}
where $x_{a,r,t}$ represents material mass flow on arc $a$, $\tau_a$ is transit delay, $Q_{r,t}$ is local production, and $\text{Cons}_{r,t}$ is total consumption for growth and city building.

\subsubsection{Transport Capacity Limits}
Traffic on the network is strictly bounded by infrastructure maturity. For rockets, we define $y_{a,t}$ as the integer number of launches, linked to mass flow by payload capacity $m_{load}^{rock}$.
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r} x_{a_{rock},r,t} \le y_{t} \cdot m_{load}^{rock}, \quad y_{t} \le L_{cap}(t)
\end{equation}
For the Space Elevator, defined by the "Aggregate Galactic Harbour," the constraint is directly on mass throughput:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r} x_{a_{elev},r,t} \le C_E(t)
\end{equation}
The rocket limit $L_{cap}(t)$ follows the logistic saturation curve derived in Section 3.1, while the elevator capacity $C_E(t)$ represents the unified throughput of the Galactic Harbour system.

\subsection{Layer 2: Endogenous Industrial Growth Model}

Coupling with the transport layer, we employ a continuous \textbf{Endogenous Growth Model}\textsuperscript{\cite{freitas1981}} for the "Tactical Construction Scheduler" (Layer 2). The colony's industrial base $P(t)$ is fueled by the arrival of specific Tier 1 "seed" materials from Layer 1.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:growth}
P(t) \le (1 - \delta)P(t-1) + \beta \cdot \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}_{arr}} x_{a, Tier1, t-\tau_a} + \alpha \cdot \Delta_{Growth}(t)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\delta$: Depreciation rate of lunar machinery (wear and tear).
    \item $\beta$: Capital effectiveness of imported high-tech equipment (Tier 1) in establishing new capacity ("Seeding").
    \item $\alpha$: Efficiency of utilizing local ISRU materials ($\Delta_{Growth}$) to replicate existing infrastructure ("Self-Replication").
\end{itemize}

Local production is constrained by this capacity:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} Q_{r,t} \le P(t)
\end{equation}

And material reinvestment is limited by available inventory:
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{Growth}(t) \le I_{Moon, Structure, t}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Objective Function}
The global objective minimizes total mission cost while maximizing the early accumulation of city mass (proxy for completion speed):
\begin{equation}
\min J = w_C \sum_{t} \text{Cost}(t) - w_T \sum_{t} \text{CumulativeCityMass}(t)
\end{equation}
Maximizing the integral of city mass mathematically drives the solver to achieve the target population capacity as early as possible.

\subsection{Simulation Results and Interpretation}

\subsubsection{Scenario Dominance and Trade-offs}

The simulation results illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:scenario_comparison} demonstrate that the hybrid approach defined as \textbf{Scenario C} offers the most effective balance between project duration and cost efficiency. This optimal configuration achieves full colony completion in 25.5 years, aligning with the project calendar year 2076. In contrast, while the elevator-exclusive strategy of Scenario A remains a viable alternative by meeting the 50-year deadline at 37.3 years, it lacks the initial industrial acceleration provided by chemical propulsion. The rocket-exclusive approach of Scenario B is found to be non-compliant with the MCM Agency's mission goals, as the saturation of global launch cadences extends the construction timeline beyond 60 years.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/scenario_comparison.png}
\caption{Comparative Performance Analysis: Scenario C minimizes duration to 25.5 years with a total expenditure of \$1.03B, significantly outperforming the 37.3-year timeline of Scenario A and the non-compliant duration of Scenario B.}
\label{fig:scenario_comparison}
\end{figure}

The hybrid model specifically addresses the ``Cold Start'' problem inherent in large-scale space infrastructure projects. Under this strategy, heavy-lift rockets are deployed to transport the inaugural 0.04 million tons of high-complexity technological seeds, including Tier 1 electronics and precision robotics. Meanwhile, the Space Elevator functions as the backbone of the heavy-lift supply chain, ferrying 0.13 million tons of industrial equipment during the critical bootstrapping phase. This dual-modal integration ensures that the limited elevator lift cycles are not bottlenecked by high-priority items that demand immediate deployment to trigger lunar growth.

\subsubsection{Bootstrapping and Mass Sourcing Evolution}

Our model validates the \textbf{System Bootstrapping Effect} as the definitive factor in mission success. Upon reaching the 100,000-person capacity, 80.0\% of the 100-million-ton cumulative material requirement is sourced directly via lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization. This high localization rate fundamentally reduces the project’s long-term dependency on the Earth-to-Moon transport corridor.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/material_river.png}
\caption{Material Composition Evolution: The colony transitions from total Earth-dependence in 2050 to 80\% self-sufficiency, driven by the exponential accumulation of lunar production capacity.}
\label{fig:material_river}
\end{figure}

The transition shown in the River Plot in Figure \ref{fig:material_river} highlights the decoupling of lunar colony mass from Earth’s launch capacity. An initial investment of 0.17 million tons of Earth-sourced capital stock, provided by both the rocket fleet and the Galactic Harbour, serves as an industrial multiplier. This seeding allows the exponential replication of production capacity , which eventually sustains the high-volume construction requirements of the habitation expansion phase.

\subsubsection{Optimal Construction Timeline}

The optimization solver identifies a compressed critical path consisting of three distinct industrial stages. The first stage, defined as \textbf{Industrial Seeding}, occupies the period from 2050.0 to 2050.2. This is followed by the \textbf{Capacity Self-Replication} phase, which concludes by 2053.0. The final and longest stage is the \textbf{Urban Habitation Expansion}, which utilizes the established industrial base to complete the colony by 2075.5.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/construction_gantt.png}
\caption{Optimal Construction Schedule: The timeline prioritizes a brief three-month seeding phase followed by a three-year replication period to ensure that habitation modules are constructed using a mature and localized industrial infrastructure.}
\label{fig:construction_gantt}
\end{figure}

The explicit focus on a self-replication phase confirms that the optimal strategy prioritizes a short but intensive burst of industrial scaling before committing to the linear task of building human habitats. This tactical staging minimizes the overall project duration by ensuring that habitation modules are constructed only after a robust production capacity is fully operational.


\section{Model II: System Robustness and Risk Assessment}

\subsection{Stochastic Imperfection Modeling}

In our revised risk framework, we categorize systemic ``imperfections'' based on their mathematical impact on the logistical throughput. This simplification allows us to isolate the specific sensitivities of the bootstrapping process without the confounding variables of long-term state transitions.

\subsubsection{Elevator Performance Degradation: Continuous Efficiency Loss}
The Space Elevator system, while providing high steady-state capacity, is subject to performance degradation primarily driven by the mechanical swaying of the 100,000 km graphene tethers and necessary maintenance cycles. We model the effective annual throughput $\Phi_{eff}(t)$ as a function of the ideal capacity $C_h$ and a stochastic efficiency factor $\eta_h(t)$:

\begin{equation}
\Phi_{eff}(t) = \sum_{h=1}^{3} C_{h} \cdot \eta_h(t)
\end{equation}

The efficiency factor $\eta_h(t)$ represents the ratio of actual payload delivery to the theoretical maximum. To capture the variability inherent in Coriolis-induced oscillations and climber maintenance, we model $\eta_h(t)$ using a Beta distribution, $\eta_h \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha=17, \beta=3)$, where the parameters are calibrated to reflect an average performance loss of $15\%$. This approach ensures that while the elevator remains the primary bulk carrier, its contribution is inherently volatile, reflecting the physical constraints of a large-scale orbital infrastructure.

\subsubsection{Rocket Discrete Mission Loss: Stochastic Failure and Material Impact}
In contrast to the continuous degradation of the elevator, the rocket system is characterized by discrete mission failures. Each launch $L_j$ is treated as a Bernoulli trial, where the successful delivery of payload is a binary event. The cumulative mass $M_{delivered}$ from the rocket fleet is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
M_{delivered} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} L_{payload} \cdot X_j, \quad X_j \sim \text{Bernoulli}(P_s)
\end{equation}

where $P_s=0.985$ denotes the probability of mission success and $L_{payload}$ represents the carrying capacity of the heavy-lift vehicles. The profound impact of this failure mode lies in its timing. Since our model relies on a ``robot-first'' bootstrapping logic, the loss of a Tier 1 precision payload (e.g., robotic control units or high-density energy modules) early in the mission generates a cascading delay. This occurs because the subsequent lunar production rate $P(t)$ is directly proportional to the "seeds" planted in the preceding phases. Consequently, a single early failure can shift the entire industrial growth curve, whereas a later failure in Tier 3 material delivery merely incurs a linear volume loss.

\subsection{Simulation Results: Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis}

Following the implementation of the stochastic variables, we present a multi-dimensional analysis of the colony's viability. This section utilizes Monte Carlo simulations ($N=1000$) and impulse response analysis to quantify the resilience of Scenario C.

\subsubsection{Analysis of Bootstrap Latency Propagation}

The first dimension of our results focuses on the temporal sensitivity of the bootstrapping process. By injecting a standardized 50,000-ton material loss at different points in the project lifecycle, we observe the resulting increment in the total completion time $\Delta T$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/risk_impulse_response.png}
    \caption{The Butterfly Effect of Bootstrap Latency. The Impulse Response Curve illustrates that a failure in the initial ``Seeding Phase'' (2050--2052) generates a disproportionate impact ($\Delta T \approx 0.03$ years per event) compared to later phases. The exponential decay of sensitivity confirms that the mission's risk is strictly front-loaded.}
    \label{fig:impulse_response}
\end{figure}

The results (Figure \ref{fig:impulse_response}) demonstrate a clear decaying sensitivity curve: a failure in the initial ``Seeding Phase'' (2050--2053) generates a maximum delay impact, whereas failures in the mature ``Replication Phase'' have diminished effects. This nonlinear response confirms the ``Butterfly Effect'' hypothesis: early payloads contain the critical Tier 1 machinery required to initiate In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Once the industrial base is established, the system's self-replication capacity buffers against individual mission losses.

\subsubsection{Probabilistic Distribution of Mission Outcomes}

The overall mission stability is evaluated through 1,000 Monte Carlo iterations to stress-test the deterministic baseline of 25.4 years (Completion Year 2075.4).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/risk_prob_dist.png}
    \caption{Probability Distributions of Duration and Cost. (Left) The completion time distribution is tightly clustered (Mean 2077.4 years), indicating high schedule reliability. (Right) The total cost distribution is bounded with a mean of \$1.21 Trillion, validating the financial feasibility of the hybrid model even under pessimistic failure rates.}
    \label{fig:risk_dist}
\end{figure}

The probability density function (Figure \ref{fig:risk_dist}) reveals a robust system with a mean completion year of \textbf{2077.4}, representing an average stochastic delay of only $\sim$2 years compared to the deterministic baseline. The narrow 95\% confidence interval [2077.3, 2077.4] suggests that the hybrid logistics architecture effectively dampens the variance of individual component failures. Financially, the mission cost is normally distributed with a mean of \textbf{\$1.21 Trillion}, providing a credible bounds for budget allocation.

\subsubsection{System Resilience and Capacity Redundancy}

Finally, we investigate the ``self-healing'' properties of our hybrid logistics model. By simulating a period of severe tether swaying (where $\eta$ drops significantly), we observe the dynamic reallocation of cargo between the transport modes.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/risk_elasticity.png}
    \caption{Elasticity of Transport Redundancy. During a simulated Space Elevator degradtion (red zone), the rocket fleet (purple) automatically surges to compensate for the lost throughput. This dynamic substitution ensures that critical Tier 1/2 material flows are maintained despite infrastructure degradation.}
    \label{fig:risk_elasticity}
\end{figure}

The analysis (Figure \ref{fig:risk_elasticity}) confirms that the hybrid system possesses inherent operational elasticity: as the Space Elevator's throughput declines due to simulated environmental stress, the optimization logic automatically increases the utilization of the rocket fleet. This synergy validates the strategic superiority of Scenario C; the rocket fleet acts as a high-availability ``circulatory system'' that compensates for the fluctuations of the high-capacity ``spine'' (Space Elevator), ensuring that the critical bootstrapping threshold is always maintained.


\section{Model III: Water as a Stock-Flow Constraint on Logistical Growth}

\subsection{Governing Equations and Physical Analysis}

To rigorously evaluate the impact of hydrological requirements on the colonization timeline, we formulate the water supply problem not as a static daily demand, but as a dynamic \textbf{Stock-Flow Constraint} coupled with the capacity limits of the transport network. We define water as a \textbf{Tier-3 Inventory Resource}, characterized by strictly consumable properties (non-recyclable losses) and varying storage thresholds.

\subsubsection{Demand Decomposition and Net Loss}
Let $N(t)$ denote the colony population and $\dot{M}_{base}(t)$ the industrial construction rate. We decompose the gross daily water demand into three distinct streams:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
C_{dom}(t) &= N(t) \cdot w_{dom} \\
C_{ag}(t) &= N(t) \cdot w_{ag} \\
C_{ind}(t) &= \kappa \cdot \dot{M}_{base}(t)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $w_{dom}$ and $w_{ag}$ represent the per capita requirements for domestic and agricultural use, and $\kappa$ denotes the water intensity of industrial processing (ton-water per ton-product).

Crucially, the decision variable for the logistics system is not the gross demand, but the \textbf{Irreducible Net Loss} $\ell(t)$. Incorporating the distinct recycling efficiencies for biological ($\eta_{bio}$) and industrial ($\eta_{ind}$) cycles, and accounting for structural leakage $\lambda$, the total system loss rate is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\ell(t) = (1-\eta_{bio})[C_{dom}(t) + C_{ag}(t)] + (1-\eta_{ind})C_{ind}(t) + \lambda W(t)
\end{equation}
This formulation reveals that even with high recycling efficiency ($\eta \to 0.96$), the colony experiences a persistent inventory bleed that necessitates continuous external replenishment.

\subsubsection{Inventory Dynamics and Inhabitation Gate}
The evolution of the available water inventory $W(t)$ is governed by the conservation law:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dW}{dt} = q_E(t) + q_L(t) - \ell(t)
\end{equation}
where $q_E(t)$ represents imports from Earth (via Space Elevator) and $q_L(t)$ denotes local extraction via ISRU.

The transition from the robotic construction phase to human habitation is modeled as a \textbf{Threshold Constraint}. The colony cannot accept residents until the inventory satisfies a safety gate $W_{gate}$, comprising both ecological charging volume and a strategic safety buffer:
\begin{equation}
W(t_{in}) \ge W_{gate} = W_{eco} + W_{buf}
\end{equation}
This constraint enforces a logical dependency: the transport network must accumulate the stock $W_{gate}$ prior to $t_{in}$, effectively preventing premature colonization.

\subsection{Coupling Quantification: Opportunity Cost of Transport}

The delivery of water exerts a parasitic effect on the industrial growth rate by competing for limited transport capacity. In the Time-Dependent Multi-Commodity Network Flow (TDMCNF) framework, the flow of water $x^w_{ij,t}$ shares the finite arc capacity $U_{ij,t}$ with critical capital goods:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k \in \{Tier1, Tier2, Tier3\}} x^k_{ij,t} + x^w_{ij,t} \le U_{ij,t}
\end{equation}
Consequently, any increase in water transport $q_E(t)$ directly displaces the flow of high-value "Industrial Seeds" ($S_{seed}$), which are the drivers of exponential growth. We define the \textbf{Effective Seed Input} as:
\begin{equation}
S_{seed}(t) = S_{seed}^{(0)}(t) - \chi \cdot q_E^{(pre)}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\chi \approx 1$ represents the capacity substitution ratio. By reducing the inflow of self-replicating machinery ($S_{seed}$), the water requirement retards the colony's industrial expansion rate $\dot{\mathcal{I}}(t) = f(\mathcal{I}, S_{seed})$, resulting in a temporal shift of the completion horizon.

The \textbf{Additional Timeline} ($\Delta T$) is thus mathematically defined as the time-shift required to match the baseline industrial mass $M_{base}^{(0)}$ under the water-constrained regime:
\begin{equation}
M_{base}^{(water)}(t) \approx M_{base}^{(0)}(t - \Delta T)
\end{equation}

Similarly, the \textbf{Additional Cost} is derived by summing the transport costs of the water inventory and the fixed capital expenditure ($F_{ISRU}$) for establishing local extraction infrastructure:
\begin{equation}
\Delta C = \sum_{t} c_E(t) \cdot q_E(t) + z \cdot F_{ISRU} - \text{Cost}_{baseline}
\end{equation}
where $z \in \{0,1\}$ is the binary decision variable for ISRU deployment.

\subsection{Simulation Results and Sensitivity Analysis}

\subsubsection{Hydrological Surge and Inventory Strategy}
The simulation results, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:water_dynamics}, delineate the hydrological lifecycle and strategic planning. Panel (a) shows that the system remains in a low-consumption state during the initial robotic phase. However, as the timeline approaches the habitation target, the requirement for $W_{gate}$ triggers a massive logistic demand, necessitating a diversion of elevator capacity from structural materials to water.

Comparison of inventory accumulation policies in Panel (b) indicates that a \textbf{Pre-emptive Strategy} is strictly dominant. By gradually accumulating $W_{gate}$ during periods of slack elevator capacity (2056-2076), the system avoids a ``Logistical Stall'' at the critical inhabitation juncture.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/water_dynamics.png}
\caption{Water Dynamics Analysis. (a) Evolution of Hydrological Turnover showing the distinct phases of water consumption: low-volume industrial demand during construction, followed by a massive surge in agricultural and domestic demand upon inhabitation in 2076. (b) Comparison of Water Inventory Accumulation Strategies: the Pre-emptive strategy (green) utilizes spare transport capacity to fill the 500,000-ton reservoir before habitation, whereas a reactive approach (red) would cause a catastrophic delay.}
\label{fig:water_dynamics}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Quantification of Logistical Latency}
The ``Butterfly Effect'' of capacity displacement is quantified in Figure \ref{fig:water_impact}(a). The requirement to transport the bulk inventory $W_{gate}$ via Earth-Moon transfer displaces approximately 6\% of the potential robotic seed mass during the growth phase. This displacement results in a dampening of the exponential growth coefficient, causing a cumulative \textbf{Additional Timeline of 1.2 years}. This delay is not merely a transport lag but a systemic retardation of industrial self-replication.

\subsubsection{Cost Impact and Payload Reconfiguration}
The categorization of payloads in Figure \ref{fig:water_impact}(b) confirms the shift from high-value ``Seeds'' to high-volume ``Sustenance.''

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/water_impact.png}
\caption{Water Impact Analysis. (a) Visualization of Growth Retardation: the water transport requirement introduces a 1.2-year delay ($\Delta T$) in achieving the 100-million-ton infrastructure target. (b) Payload Composition Analysis: Construction Phase (2050-2075) is dominated by industrial capital goods, while Maintenance Phase (post-2076) shows water replenishment and life support consumables constituting 67\% of logistics volume.}
\label{fig:water_impact}
\end{figure}

The financial analysis yields an \textbf{Additional Cost of \$89.1 Billion} over the project lifecycle. This significant expenditure is driven by two factors: the increased capital requirement for high-capacity ISRU infrastructure ($F_{ISRU} = \$20.0\text{B}$) and the substantial logistic burden of maintaining a hydrological inventory against higher agricultural demands ($w_{ag} = 100 \text{ kg/cap/day}$) and conservative recycling efficiencies ($\eta_{bio} = 0.96$). Sensitivity analysis confirms that without pre-emptive ISRU extraction, the recurring annual replenishment of 175,200 tons would be economically prohibitive. Thus, the \$89.1B investment represents a critical foundational cost for ensuring biological viability.

\begin{quote}
Estimating the water requirements for a lunar colony is a massive undertaking in logistics. For context, while a person on Earth might use \textbf{80--100 gallons} of water a day, space-faring systems are designed for extreme lean operations.

Here are the specific metrics you need for your estimation based on current NASA and ISS standards.

\textbf{1. Average Daily Consumption on the ISS}

On the International Space Station, water is strictly rationed to minimize ``up-mass'' (the weight of supplies launched from Earth).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total Daily Use:} Approximately \textbf{1 gallon (3.78 liters)} per person.
    \item \textbf{Breakdown:} This includes drinking water, food rehydration, and medical/hygiene needs (such as brushing teeth).
    \item \textbf{Note:} Because there are no showers on the ISS, hygiene water is significantly lower than it would be in a permanent lunar colony.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Current Recycling Efficiency}

As of 2026, recycling systems have reached a major technical milestone.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{98\% Recovery Rate:} NASA's Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) recently achieved a \textbf{98\% water recovery rate}.
    \item \textbf{The Technology:} This was made possible by the \textbf{Brine Processor Assembly (BPA)}, which extracts the last bits of water from urine brine---a byproduct that previously had to be discarded.
\end{itemize}

\hrulefill

\textbf{3. Calculation for a Moon Colony (100,000 People)}

Using your specified \textbf{96\% recycling rate} and the ISS standard of \textbf{1 gallon per person/day}, here is the projected makeup water requirement:

\textbf{Given Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Population:} 100,000 people
    \item \textbf{Daily Consumption per Person:} 1 gallon
    \item \textbf{Recycling Efficiency:} 96\% (Loss rate = 4\%)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step-by-Step Calculation:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Total Daily Consumption:}
    $100,000 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ gallon/day} = 100,000 \text{ gallons/day}$
    \item \textbf{Daily Makeup Water (New water needed to replace losses):}
    $100,000 \text{ gallons/day} \times 0.04 = 4,000 \text{ gallons/day}$
    \item \textbf{Annual Makeup Water:}
    $4,000 \text{ gallons/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} = 1,460,000 \text{ gallons/year}$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
    \fbox{
        \begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
            \textbf{Summary:} For a colony of 100,000 people, you would need to source or transport \textbf{1.46 million gallons} of new water every year to maintain the cycle.
