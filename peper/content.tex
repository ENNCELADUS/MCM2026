\begin{abstract}
Stair wear patterns in historic buildings can provide valuable archaeological evidence regarding the building's age, usage and traffic patterns throughout history. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive mathematical framework to analyze wear patterns and provide archaeologists with quatitative tools for historical interpretation.
    
First, we establish a non-destructive measurement methodology including \textbf{physical, chemical and biological} measurements. Physical measurements involve \textbf{3D scanning} of stairs and monocular depth estimation. Chemical measurements include \textbf{isotope analysis} and mineral composition testing. Biological measurements involve the study of microbial colonies.
Then, we personally collected top-down photos of stairs from ancient buildings. Using \textbf{depth map estimation} methods, we drew heatmaps and obtained wear data.

Following data collection, we address the challenge of quantifying wear volume from discrete point cloud data. We employ\textbf{ Delaunay triangulation} to transform the theoretical volume integral into a weighted summation of local triangular volumes, thus accurately calculating spatial wear volume.

Second, we build a \textbf{Daily Foot Traffic Model} based on the Archard equation. We take \textbf{Archard Adhesive Wear Model} and \textbf{Abrasive Wear Model} both into consideration. Besides, we use \textbf{Bayesian Inversion Framework} to calculate the construction time to provide essential parameter.

Third, we establish a \textbf{Wear Distribution Model} to determine movement patterns and simultaneous occupancy levels. The model analyzes wear patterns to deduce whether people moved in single file or side by side, and whether there were predominant directional preferences.

For age estimation, we employ multiple approaches: \textbf{C14 dating method} for wooden staircases, \textbf{weathering degree analysis} for stone staircases, and \textbf{Bayesian inversion}.We constructed a \textbf{weighted evaluation model} of three representative \textbf{Chemistry Weathering Indecies} to evaluate the weathering condition of stone, providing information about its age.

To detect repairs or renovations, we analyze age distribution discontinuities using anomaly detection methods like the \textbf{Z-score}. We also verify the consistency of wear patterns with available historical information. For material source verification, we use the \textbf{Archard Wear Model} to calculate wear coefficients and perform chemical composition analysis to trace the origin of materials. We analyze usage patterns by examining the distribution of wear depth. By calculating the kurtosis of the distribution, we determine the usage pattern of stairs.

Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the key parameters of our model to evaluate its responsiveness. The results demonstrate strong robustness.  

\textbf{Key Words:} Stair Wear, Archard Equation, Depth Estimation, Weathering Degree Model, Bayesian Inversion

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Background}
The dream of extending human civilization to the Moon has transitioned from science fiction to a pressing logistical challenge as we approach the mid-21st century. At the heart of this ambition lies the fundamental problem of Earth-to-Moon transportation. Traditionally, space exploration has relied exclusively on rocket propulsion systems, such as the advanced Falcon Heavy, which are estimated to carry between 100 to 150 metric tons of payload to the lunar surface per launch by 2050. While reliable, traditional chemical rockets are inherently limited by the "rocket equation," where a significant portion of the launch mass must be dedicated to fuel, resulting in high costs and substantial atmospheric pollution.

To overcome these barriers, the concept of a Space Elevator System offers a revolutionary paradigm for interplanetary logistics. This system is envisioned as a scalable, electrically powered infrastructure consisting of three "Galactic Harbours" strategically positioned 120 degrees apart along the Earth's equator. Each harbour comprises a single Earth port connected via two 100,000 km-long graphene tethers to apex anchors. Unlike the single-step trajectory of a rocket, the Space Elevator employs a two-step delivery process: payloads are first lifted from the Earth port to the apex anchor, and then ferried to the Moon via specialized rockets using significantly less fuel. This infrastructure promises a "green" alternative capable of moving 179,000 metric tons annually without atmospheric degradation, providing a consistent and cost-effective corridor to space.

The major problems dealt with in this paper will be specified in Section 1.3.

\subsection{Literature Review}
Our research focuses 

\subsection{Problem Restatement and Analysis}

To provide the Moon Colony Management Agency with a concise yet robust framework, we restate the project requirements for transporting  million metric tons of material to support a 100,000-person colony by 2050. After normalizing technical parameters for both Galactic Harbours and rocket launch sites, we address the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Problem 1.} Calculate and compare the total time required to transport  tons across exclusive elevator, exclusive rocket, and hybrid delivery modes.
\item \textbf{Problem 2.} Quantify total expenditures, specifically contrasting the two-step elevator delivery process against the single-step direct rocket launch.
\item \textbf{Problem 3.} Determine the optimal allocation ratio between elevator and rocket systems to maximize mass throughput while minimizing total economic burden.
\item \textbf{Problem 4.} Evaluate fluctuations in cost and timeline under non-ideal conditions, such as tether swaying, mechanical failures, or rocket anomalies.
\item \textbf{Problem 5.} Investigate the total annual water needs to sustain a fully operational colony of 100,000 inhabitants.
\item \textbf{Problem 6.} Calculate additional costs and delivery cycles required to ensure sufficient life-support supplies for the colony’s inaugural year.
\item \textbf{Problem 7.} Analyze atmospheric pollution and ecological damage, contrasting the green efficiency of elevators with traditional chemical propulsion.
\item \textbf{Problem 8.} Develop adjustments to the logistical models to minimize environmental degradation without compromising critical material flow rates.
\end{itemize}

Finally, we will synthesize these findings into a one-page strategic recommendation letter addressed to the MCM Agency.

\section{Methodology and Model Formulation}

\subsection{Strategic Framework: Autonomous Lunar Urbanization}

Our design for the establishment of a 100,000-person lunar colony is formulated as a dynamic process of autonomous industrial evolution. Our strategy prioritizes a \textbf{"Robot-First" developmental logic}, where the initial infrastructure is entirely managed and executed by intelligent robotic units. In this framework, the construction of human living quarters represents the terminal phase; once the habitation zones are operational and life-support systems are verified, the colony establishment process is considered complete. This approach ensures that the lunar environment is fundamentally transformed into a habitable urban center before the first human residents arrive.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{unwatermarked_流程图.png}
    \caption{The Lunar Urbanization Timeline}
    \label{fig:timeline}
\end{figure}

We envision the lunar base's development through a trajectory analogous to terrestrial urbanization but accelerated by robotic efficiencies. Unlike human labor, which is limited by long upbringing cycles, a robotic labor force can be instantaneously deployed upon the establishment of the manufacturing chain. This workforce initiates a self-reinforcing productivity surge that evolves through three strategic stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Bootstrapping Phase:} A "seeding" stage where high-complexity foundational infrastructure and precision components are transported from Earth to establish initial lunar industrial capacity. 
    \item \textbf{The Self-Replication Phase:} A growth explosion where robots utilize In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) to fabricate new labor units and infrastructure, triggering exponential output. 
    \item \textbf{The Saturation Phase:} A logistic stabilization period where growth slows as the colony approaches physical limits, such as thermal dissipation at the lunar poles and cosmic radiation degradation.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Notations}
To ensure the clarity and consistency of the mathematical framework, we define a set of primary notations used in our logistics and construction models. These symbols represent the temporal, spatial, and functional components of the Earth-Moon transportation network.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}




\subsection{Assumptions}
Through a complete analysis of the interplanetary logistics problem, in order to simplify our model and ensure computational tractability, we make the following reasonable assumptions based on the physical constraints and technological projections of 2050.

\textbf{Assumption 1: Technical continuity and logistic growth of rocket systems.}

The rocket technology available in 2050 is assumed to be a mature evolution of current systems like Starship and Falcon Heavy[cite: 1047, 1107]. However, the expansion of rocket transport is not infinite; it is constrained by the finite number of global launch sites, such as those in Florida, Kazakhstan, and China. Consequently, we assume the growth of total rocket launch capacity follows a Logistic Growth Model, where the capacity initially increases rapidly but eventually approaches a saturation point determined by environmental and geographical limits].

\textbf{Assumption 2: Physical limits and safety stress of the space elevator system.}

We assume that material science has advanced sufficiently to produce carbon nanotubes (CNT) or graphene with the theoretical strength required for a 100,000 km tether. Nevertheless, the system is subject to strict mechanical safety factors. To prevent tether rupture or excessive swaying, we assume there is a fixed upper limit on the instantaneous payload mass and operational speed, resulting in a maximum annual throughput capacity for each Galactic Harbour.

\textbf{Assumption 3: Seamless transfer from the Galactic Harbour to the Moon.}

The transport process involves a two-step delivery: from Earth to the apex anchor, and then from the anchor to the Moon. We assume that the second leg of this journey is highly efficient and that the rocket ferries operating between the apex anchor and the lunar surface have sufficient capacity to handle all incoming cargo. Therefore, the system's bottleneck is assumed to reside solely in the Earth-to-apex lift phase, rather than the subsequent lunar delivery.

\textbf{Assumption 4: Feasibility of In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU).}

To meet the 100 million metric ton requirement, we assume that lunar regolith and water ice can be successfully extracted and processed into bulk building materials and chemical propellants. This allows for a "system bootstrapping" effect where early infrastructure enables the local production of materials, significantly reducing the total mass that must be transported from Earth's deep gravity well.

\textbf{Assumption 5: Spatial Aggregation of Earth Nodes.}

To reduce computational complexity without losing strategic fidelity, we treat the three equatorial Galactic Harbours as a single super-node, the "Aggregate Galactic Harbour," with a unified capacity sum. Similarly, all global rocket launch sites are modeled as a single "Aggregate Earth Launch Site." This abstraction is valid because the transit time and cost differences between Earth surface locations are negligible compared to the magnitude of interplanetary logistics.

\textbf{Assumption 6: Temporal Discretization.}

The 50-year planning horizon is discretized into monthly intervals ($\Delta t = 1$ month). We assume that material flows, production rates, and resource consumption remain constant within each time step, allowing us to approximate continuous dynamics with a discrete-time difference equation model.

To continue the development of our mathematical framework, we define the operational dynamics of the two primary transportation systems and establish a strategic classification for the materials required for lunar colonization.

\subsection{Material Classification and Logistics Strategy}

To optimize the 100 million metric ton delivery requirement, the \textbf{Equivalent Mass Dynamic Allocation (EMDA)} model categorizes materials by complexity ($\chi$) and value density to determine if they are Earth-transported or produced via lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU).

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\caption{Material Classification and Logistical Strategy}
\label{tab:material_strat}
\begin{tabular}{lp{4.5cm}cp{5.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Typical Components} & \boldmath$\chi_i$ & \textbf{Logistical Strategy \& Mass Ratio} \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{Tier 1: Precision} & Chips, robot brains, precision bio-pharmaceuticals & $\approx 1.0$ & 100\% Earth transport. Mandatory delivery of high-complexity seeds. (15\% Initial $\to$ $<$1\% Mature) \\ 

\textbf{Tier 2: Industrial} & Machine tool parts, flexible films, motors & $0.3 - 0.7$ & Hybrid sourcing. Core components from Earth enable lunar replication. (35\% Initial $\to$ $\sim$4\% Mature) \\ 

\textbf{Tier 3: Basic} & Structural frames, regolith bricks, oxygen, shielding water & $\approx 0.0$ & 100\% lunar ISRU. Bulk materials produced locally to minimize logistical load. (50\% Initial $\to$ $\sim$95\% Mature) \\ 
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The mission utilizes a \textbf{System Bootstrapping Effect}, where Tier 1 "seeds" enable the growth of lunar production capacity $P_r(t)$. We define the \textbf{Localization Rate} $k_i(t)$ as the ratio of ISRU materials to the total demand for task $i$:
\begin{equation}
k_i(t) = \frac{q^M_{i,t}}{q^M_{i,t} + q^E_{i,t}} \in [0, 1]
\end{equation}
The evolution of $k_i(t)$ is driven by $P_r(t)$, which follows a self-reinforcing differential equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP_r(t)}{dt} = \alpha \cdot P_r(t) + \beta \cdot T_{seed}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the self-replication efficiency and $\beta$ is the input factor of high-complexity Tier 1 components ($T_{seed}$). As $P_r(t)$ increases, $k_i(t)$ for Tier 2 and Tier 3 materials scales accordingly, allowing the colony mass to grow exponentially while the transport burden remains focused on high-value technological payloads.





\subsection{Transport Capacity and Cost Modeling}

The evaluation of the Earth-Moon supply chain requires a rigorous definition of how transport capacity evolves and how operational costs fluctuate over the fifty-year construction horizon. We model the two competing systems—chemical rockets and the space elevator—using distinct mathematical approaches that reflect their unique physical and economic constraints.

\subsubsection{Rocket System Modeling}
The capacity evolution of chemical rocket systems is modeled not by astrodynamics constraints, but by rigorous ground infrastructure analysis. We employ a \textbf{Logistic Growth Model} for the annual launch capacity $L_{cap}(t)$:
\begin{equation}
L_{cap}(t) = \frac{L_{max}}{1 + A \cdot e^{-r(t - t_0)}}
\end{equation}
where $L_{max}$ defines the infrastructure saturation ceiling. Unlike theoretical orbital limits, this cap is dictated by range operations, pad turnaround times, and safety protocols. Empirical data shows global orbital attempts reaching a peak of 329 in 2025~\cite{mcdowell2024}. The United States Space Force (USSF) has demonstrated high-cadence feasibility with 93 launches from the Eastern Range and 51 from Vandenberg in 2024, executing 28 instances of "2 launches in 24 hours" since 2022~\cite{mcdowell2024}. However, GAO reports flag significant range strain, indicating that while cadence can surge, it cannot scale indefinitely. Consequently, we set a conservative infrastructure ceiling of $L_{max} \approx 1500$ launches/year, assuming a handful of major global spaceports each sustaining operations of 200-300 launches annually.

Parallel to capacity, the unit cost of rocket transport follows a \textbf{Floor-Constrained Exponential Decay Model}, fitted to historical market rates from 2005 to 2024 (dropping from $\sim\$25,000/$kg to $\sim\$1,500/$kg)~\cite{csis2024}:
\begin{equation}
Cost_R(t) = (C_{start} - C_{min}) \cdot e^{-\lambda (t - t_{start})} + C_{min}
\end{equation}
Our regression analysis yields a decay rate $\lambda \approx 0.17$, with a projected floor $C_{min} = \$100/$kg. This non-zero floor is critical, representing the irreducible physical costs of propellant, refurbishment, and range operations that persist even with fully reusable architectures.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{rocket_model.png}
    \caption{Projected Evolution of Rocket Systems (2000-2100). (Left) Launch frequency saturation governed by infrastructure limits ($L_{max}=1500$). (Right) Cost reduction curve stabilizing at the \$100/kg operational floor.}
    \label{fig:rocket_model}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Space Elevator System Modeling}

In contrast to the variable dynamics of rocket systems, the Space Elevator System is modeled as a steady-state infrastructure providing continuous throughput. We define its transport capacity $C_E(t)$ as a fixed parameter, anchored to the MCM Agency's baseline specification:
\begin{equation}
C_E(t) = C_{E,ref} \quad \forall t \ge t_0
\end{equation}
Substituting the design parameters for the ``Aggregated Galactic Harbour'' (3 harbours, 2 tethers each), we adopt the constant service rate:
\begin{equation}
C_E(t) = 537,000 \text{ metric tons/year}
\end{equation}
This formulation assumes that the initial deployment phase (2040--2050) has completed, allowing the system to operate at its nominal capacity from the start of the simulation ($t_0=2050$). The capacity is strictly constrained by the tether material strength and climber velocity ($v \approx 200$ km/h), ensuring physical plausibility without assuming speculative upgrades during the project horizon.

Economically, the elevator follows a \textbf{Floor-Constrained Exponential Decay Model}, benefiting from low marginal costs driven by electricity and maintenance efficiencies. We model the unit cost dropping from an initial \$50/kg to a mature floor of \$5/kg:
\begin{equation}
Cost_E(t) = (C_{start} - C_{min}) \cdot e^{-\lambda (t - t_{start})} + C_{min}
\end{equation}
where $C_{start}=\$50$, $C_{min}=\$5$, and $\lambda \approx 0.06$ (annual decay), reflecting the amortization of the massive initial infrastructure investment.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{elevator_model.png}
    \caption{Projected Evolution of Space Elevator Systems (2050-2100). (Left) Capacity growth approaching the 1 Mt/y physical ceiling. (Right) Unit cost reduction driven by economies of scale and amortized infrastructure.}
    \label{fig:elevator_model}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multi-Objective Evaluation Framework}
To rigorously assess the performance of various transportation scenarios, we define a Comprehensive Performance Index ($Z$) as our primary evaluation criterion. This framework balances temporal urgency against economic feasibility:
\begin{equation}
\min J = w_C \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} C_{total}(a, t) - w_T \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \text{CumulativeCityMass}(t)
\end{equation}
In this expression, $w_T$ and $w_C$ represent the non-negative weight coefficients assigned to time (represented by city mass accumulation) and cost, respectively. This allows the MCM Agency to calibrate the mission priority: a higher $w_T$ prioritizes rapid habitation, whereas a higher $w_C$ favors fiscal sustainability.


\section{Model I: Integrated Hierarchical Logistics Optimization}

\subsection{Optimization Architecture}

To address the coupling between interplanetary transport limits and lunar industrial bootstrapping, we propose an \textbf{Integrated Hierarchical MILP Framework}. Unlike traditional decoupled approaches, this model simultaneously optimizes the macro-level material flow (Earth-to-Moon) and the micro-level industrial capacity expansion within a single global solver.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Layer 1: Strategic Transport (Macro).} Optimizes the multi-modal flow of materials ($x_{a,r,t}$) across the Earth-Moon network, subject to the evolving capacities of the Space Elevator ($C_E(t)$) and Rocket fleet ($L(t)$).
    \item \textbf{Layer 2: Endogenous Industrial Growth (Micro).} Models the colony as a self-replicating system where "seeds" ($P_t$) and raw materials are transformed into new production capacity, governed by an Input-Output capital accumulation logic defined in Eq. \ref{eq:growth}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logistics Graph Definitions}

We define the Earth-Moon logistics interface as a directed graph $G = (\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{A})$, where the node set $\mathcal{N}$ represents the critical physical locations and $\mathcal{A}$ represents the transport arcs.

\textbf{Nodes ($\mathcal{N}$):}
Based on Assumption 5, the network consists of three primary nodes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Aggregate Earth Launch Site ($N_{launch}$):} Represents the collective capacity of all traditional rocket launch complexes (e.g., Kennedy Space Center, Wenchang, Baikonur).
    \item \textbf{Aggregate Galactic Harbour ($N_{port}$):} Represents the unified throughput of the three geostationary space elevator terminals.
    \item \textbf{Lunar Surface ($N_{moon}$):} The destination node where resources are stockpiled and consumed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Arcs ($\mathcal{A}$):}
The transport edges connect these nodes with specific attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rocket Arc ($a_{rock}$):} Direct path from $N_{launch} \to N_{moon}$. Characterized by high cost, high speed (transit time $\approx 5$ days), and capacity $L_{cap}(t)$.
    \item \textbf{Elevator Arc ($a_{elev}$):} Path from $N_{port} \to N_{moon}$. Characterized by low cost, lower speed (transit time $\approx 7$ days incl. transfer), and capacity $C_E(t)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Layer 1: Strategic Transport Constraints}

The transport layer serves as the "Strategic Transport Planner" (Layer 1), formulated as a Time-Dependent Multi-Commodity Network Flow (TDMCNF) problem. It governs the movement of material utilization $x_{a,r,t}$ across the graph $G$.

\subsubsection{Flow Conservation}
The lunar inventory state evolves based on inflows, local production, and consumption:
\begin{equation}
I_{Moon,r,t} = I_{Moon,r,t-1} + \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}_{arr}} x_{a,r,t-\tau_a} + Q_{r,t} - \text{Cons}_{r,t}
\end{equation}
where $x_{a,r,t}$ represents material mass flow on arc $a$, $\tau_a$ is transit delay, $Q_{r,t}$ is local production, and $\text{Cons}_{r,t}$ is total consumption for growth and city building.

\subsubsection{Transport Capacity Limits}
Traffic on the network is strictly bounded by infrastructure maturity. For rockets, we define $y_{a,t}$ as the integer number of launches, linked to mass flow by payload capacity $m_{load}^{rock}$.
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r} x_{a_{rock},r,t} \le y_{t} \cdot m_{load}^{rock}, \quad y_{t} \le L_{cap}(t)
\end{equation}
For the Space Elevator, defined by the "Aggregate Galactic Harbour," the constraint is directly on mass throughput:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r} x_{a_{elev},r,t} \le C_E(t)
\end{equation}
The rocket limit $L_{cap}(t)$ follows the logistic saturation curve derived in Section 3.1, while the elevator capacity $C_E(t)$ represents the unified throughput of the Galactic Harbour system.

\subsection{Layer 2: Endogenous Industrial Growth Model}

Coupling with the transport layer, we employ a continuous \textbf{Endogenous Growth Model} for the "Tactical Construction Scheduler" (Layer 2). The colony's industrial base $P(t)$ is fueled by the arrival of specific Tier 1 "seed" materials from Layer 1.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:growth}
P(t) \le (1 - \delta)P(t-1) + \beta \cdot \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}_{arr}} x_{a, Tier1, t-\tau_a} + \alpha \cdot \Delta_{Growth}(t)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\delta$: Depreciation rate of lunar machinery (wear and tear).
    \item $\beta$: Capital effectiveness of imported high-tech equipment (Tier 1) in establishing new capacity ("Seeding").
    \item $\alpha$: Efficiency of utilizing local ISRU materials ($\Delta_{Growth}$) to replicate existing infrastructure ("Self-Replication").
\end{itemize}

Local production is constrained by this capacity:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} Q_{r,t} \le P(t)
\end{equation}

And material reinvestment is limited by available inventory:
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{Growth}(t) \le I_{Moon, Structure, t}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Objective Function}
The global objective minimizes total mission cost while maximizing the early accumulation of city mass (proxy for completion speed):
\begin{equation}
\min J = w_C \sum_{t} \text{Cost}(t) - w_T \sum_{t} \text{CumulativeCityMass}(t)
\end{equation}
Maximizing the integral of city mass mathematically drives the solver to achieve the target population capacity as early as possible.

\subsection{Simulation Results and Interpretation}

\subsubsection{Scenario Dominance and Trade-offs}

Simulation results (Figure \ref{fig:scenario_comparison}) demonstrate that \textbf{Scenario C (Hybrid Model)} offers the optimal balance between project duration and cost efficiency, achieving completion in \textbf{25.5 years} (Project Year 2076). While Scenario A (Elevator-only) also meets the 50-year deadline (completing in 37.3 years), it lacks the rapid responsiveness of the hybrid approach. Scenario B (Rocket-only) fails to meet the target, requiring over 60 years due to the prohibitive logistic growth constraints on launch cadence.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/scenario_comparison.png}
    \caption{Comparative Performance Bar Chart --- Scenario C (Hybrid) minimizes duration (25.5 years) at a cost of \$1.03B. Scenario A (Elevator-only) is viable but coarser (37.3 years), while Scenario B (Rocket) is non-compliant ($>$60 years).}
    \label{fig:scenario_comparison}
\end{figure}

The hybrid model optimizes the ``Cold Start'' problem: heavy-lift rockets are utilized for the initial \textbf{0.04 million tons} of high-complexity ``technological seeds'' (Tier 1 electronics and precision machinery), while the Space Elevator assumes the role of a heavy-lift bulk carrier, transporting \textbf{0.13 million tons} of equipment during the critical bootstrapping phase. This dual-modal approach prevents bottlenecking the limited elevator throughput with high-priority, low-mass items that require immediate delivery.

\subsubsection{Bootstrapping and Mass Sourcing Evolution}

The model validates the \textbf{System Bootstrapping Effect} as a critical success factor. Upon project completion, \textbf{80.0\%} of the 100-million-ton cumulative mass requirement is satisfied via lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), dramatically reducing Earth-to-Moon transport dependancy.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/material_river.png}
    \caption{Material Composition River Plot --- The system transitions from 100\% Earth-dependence in 2050 to a steady-state 80\% lunar self-sufficiency. The initial injection of Earth-sourced capital stock ($P_0$) triggers the exponential growth of local production capabilities.}
    \label{fig:material_river}
\end{figure}

The ``River Plot'' (Figure \ref{fig:material_river}) delineates the decoupling of colony mass $M(t)$ from Earth launch capacity $L(t)$. The initial \textbf{0.17 million tons} of Earth-sourced inputs (combined Rocket and Elevator) act as an industrial multiplier, enabling the exponential replication of production capacity $P(t)$ required to sustain the later phases of heavy construction.

\subsubsection{Optimal Construction Timeline}

The optimization algorithm identifies a distinct, compressed critical path for construction, characterized by three sequential phases: (1) \textbf{Industrial Seeding} (2050.0--2050.2), (2) \textbf{Capacity Self-Replication} (2050.2--2053.0), and (3) \textbf{Urban Habitation Expansion} (2053.0--2075.5).

The majority of the project duration (2053--2076) is dedicated to the linear expansion of urban infrastructure, fully leveraging the installed ISRU capacity.}

\end{figure}

The explicit delineation of the self-replication phase confirms that the system prioritizes a brief but intense period of exponential capacity growth before committing resources to linear habitat construction. This sequential staging serves to minimize the overall project duration by establishing a robust industrial base ($P(t) \gg 0$) early in the lifecycle.


\section{Model II: System Robustness and Risk Assessment}

\subsection{Stochastic Imperfection Modeling}

In our revised risk framework, we categorize systemic "imperfections" based on their mathematical impact on the logistical throughput. This simplification allows us to isolate the specific sensitivities of the bootstrapping process without the confounding variables of long-term state transitions.

\subsubsection{Elevator Performance Degradation: Continuous Efficiency Loss}
The Space Elevator system, while providing high steady-state capacity, is subject to performance degradation primarily driven by the mechanical swaying of the 100,000 km graphene tethers and necessary maintenance cycles. We model the effective annual throughput  as a function of the ideal capacity  and a stochastic efficiency factor :

\begin{equation}
\Phi_{eff}(t) = \sum_{h=1}^{3} C_{h} \cdot \eta_h(t)
\end{equation}

The efficiency factor  represents the ratio of actual payload delivery to the theoretical maximum. To capture the variability inherent in Coriolis-induced oscillations and climber maintenance, we model  using a Beta distribution, , where the parameters are calibrated to reflect an average performance loss of . This approach ensures that while the elevator remains the primary bulk carrier, its contribution is inherently volatile, reflecting the physical constraints of a large-scale orbital infrastructure.

\subsubsection{Rocket Discrete Mission Loss: Stochastic Failure and Material Impact}
In contrast to the continuous degradation of the elevator, the rocket system is characterized by discrete mission failures. Each launch  is treated as a Bernoulli trial, where the successful delivery of payload is a binary event. The cumulative mass  from the rocket fleet is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
M_{delivered} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} L_{payload} \cdot X_j, \quad X_j \sim \text{Bernoulli}(P_s)
\end{equation}

where  denotes the probability of mission success and  represents the carrying capacity of the heavy-lift vehicles. The profound impact of this failure mode lies in its timing. Since our model relies on a "robot-first" bootstrapping logic, the loss of a Tier 1 precision payload (e.g., robotic control units or high-density energy modules) early in the mission generates a cascading delay. This occurs because the subsequent lunar production rate  is directly proportional to the "seeds" planted in the preceding phases. Consequently, a single early failure can shift the entire industrial growth curve, whereas a later failure in Tier 3 material delivery merely incurs a linear volume loss.

\subsection{Simulation Results: Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis}

Following the implementation of the stochastic variables, we present a multi-dimensional analysis of the colony's viability. This section utilizes Monte Carlo simulations and impulse response analysis to quantify the resilience of Scenario C.

\subsubsection{Analysis of Bootstrap Latency Propagation}

FIGURE 1: The Butterfly Effect of Bootstrap Latency
Description: An Impulse Response Curve showing "Year of Failure" on the X-axis and "Total Project Delay (Delta T)" on the Y-axis.
Core Message: This figure illustrates that a failure in 2050 is significantly more damaging than a failure in 2085.
Argumentation Prompt: Focus on the exponential nature of early-stage delays. Explain how the loss of industrial 'seeds' results in a lost opportunity for compound growth in lunar manufacturing capacity.

The first dimension of our results focuses on the temporal sensitivity of the bootstrapping process. By injecting a standardized 100-ton material loss at different points in the project lifecycle, we observe the resulting increment in the total completion time . The results demonstrate a clear decaying sensitivity curve: a failure in the initial "Seeding Phase" (2050–2055) generates a disproportionate impact, potentially delaying the final colonization by several years. This is because early payloads contain the critical Tier 1 machinery required to initiate In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). As the colony matures and its self-replication capacity increases, the system becomes significantly more resilient to individual mission losses, indicating that the mission's risk is front-loaded.

\subsubsection{Probabilistic Distribution of Mission Outcomes}

FIGURE 2: Probability Distributions of Duration and Cost
Description: A dual-axis Histogram/KDE plot. The left side shows the distribution of completion years; the right shows the distribution of total mission cost.
Core Message: Shows a "long-tail" or "multi-modal" distribution caused by the Bernoulli rocket failures.
Argumentation Prompt: Discuss the statistical deviation from the 45.9-year baseline. Interpret the "peaks" in the distribution as specific failure scenarios of key Tier 1/2 payloads that force the model to reset its industrial growth logic.

The overall mission stability is evaluated through 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations, revealing the statistical variance of the 45.9-year baseline. The probability density function of the construction duration exhibits a distinct right-skewed "long-tail" profile. This statistical skewness is the mathematical signature of the discrete mission loss model; while the Space Elevator's continuous degradation simply stretches the timeline linearly, the stochastic failure of rocket launches introduces the possibility of catastrophic setbacks. The multi-modal nature of the distribution suggests that project success is not a simple average but a set of distinct risk regimes, where the secondary peaks correspond to the failure of critical-path infrastructure milestones.

\subsubsection{System Resilience and Capacity Redundancy}

FIGURE 3: Elasticity of Transport Redundancy (Dynamic Area Plot)
Description: A stacked area chart showing transport volume (Elevator vs. Rocket) over time during a simulated "Swaying Event" or maintenance downtime.
Core Message: Demonstrates the "Self-healing" property where the Rocket fleet automatically increases throughput when Elevator efficiency drops.
Argumentation Prompt: Argue that the Hybrid Model (Scenario C) is superior because it provides a safety buffer. When the 'spine' (Elevator) suffers from performance degradation, the 'circulatory system' (Rockets) compensates to maintain the construction flow.

Finally, we investigate the "self-healing" properties of our hybrid logistics model. By simulating a period of severe tether swaying (where  drops to 0.6), we observe the dynamic reallocation of cargo between the transport modes. The analysis confirms that the hybrid system possesses inherent operational elasticity: as the Space Elevator's throughput declines, the model automatically increases the utilization of the rocket fleet to sustain the construction rate of high-priority Tier 2 infrastructure. This synergy validates the strategic selection of Scenario C; the rocket fleet provides the necessary tactical flexibility to bridge the gap during periods of infrastructure degradation, ensuring that the critical "bootstrapping" threshold is maintained despite systemic imperfections.
